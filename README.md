**Credits:** This game was developed entirely from text-based coding by a team of 6th, 7th, and 8th graders from Texas and was released to the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. Vector graphics were made using Assembly, and JavaScript/HTML/CSS coding was scripted with Sublime Text. Cameron Samuels was the team leader and developer, Ethan Choo was the lead graphic designer, and many other students put tireless work into this production.
